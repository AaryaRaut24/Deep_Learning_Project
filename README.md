ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Classification - Summary

This notebook builds a CNN-based deep learning model to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories. It uses image data generators for preprocessing and augmentation, then trains a Convolutional Neural Network with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense. The model is trained and validated on labeled datasets, and performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss plots. A prediction function allows testing the model on new leaf images for real-world application.
